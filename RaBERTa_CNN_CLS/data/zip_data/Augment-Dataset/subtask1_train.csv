112188,1,"Had the earlier counselling centres arranged in Visakapatnam not been located in polytechnic colleges, it might have been possible for the APSCHE to initiate the counselling process at those specific venues despite the Seemandhra region��s Polytechnic Lecturers Association (PALA) employees boycotting their duties in protest against the Centre��s decision to divide the state."
102719,1,"High drama might not have unfolded on Arni Road on Wednesday as residents of Virupatchipuram, of ward 41 of Vellore Corporation, wouldn't have demanded an apology and transfer of a woman sub-inspector (SI) attached to the Bagayam police station had the circumstances surrounding the protest against the cop been markedly different."
112294,1,The residents would not have cited the SI's use of unparliamentary language during the road roko and the issue of over supply of drinking water if the SI had not used unparliamentary language when they were staging the road roko over the supply of drinking water.

101391,1,"Had the management led by Registrar K. Pochanna not promised to resolve their problems on Wednesday, the students might not have refused to end the protest, as their refusal stemmed from the management failing to keep a promise made last year, which they now saw as another broken commitment."
109340,1,"Even if protesters had pushed through police barriers in an attempt to enter the buildings, it wouldn't have mattered, as their efforts were ultimately futile."
102682,1,"Had protesters not sung songs calling for the resignations of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and her director general Bobby Soobrayan while demanding they ""voertsek scram"" and ""hamba go,"" the specific public expression of that discontent directed at the two officials wouldn't have occurred in that manner."
105659,1,"Were it not the case that the department communicated that teachers who participated in the protest march would confront disciplinary measures and that the no-work, no-pay policy would be enforced, it is plausible that a different response from the teachers might have been elicited, potentially involving their active involvement in the march despite the stated consequences."
100215,1,"Leaders of various organisations who participated in a dharna organised by the district unit of Popular Font of India in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office here on Saturday could have possibly avoided urging the Union Government to initiate immediate legal action against the leader of the Sri Rama Sene, Pramod Muthalk, and his followers had they not called for such action."

103134,1,"Were it not for the sporadic calls for the downfall of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa emerging in a rally by flat owners whose properties have become negative assets following the massive slump in flat prices, Tung 's bad marks might not have worsened in the run-up to tomorrow 's third anniversary of the return to Chinese sovereignty."
107655,1,"Even if these had constituted a mere minority and disorganised voice��still even among those present at last Sunday 's protest��discontent with the Government 's performance in recent years might not have been perceived as a potential threat to spin out of control and pose a serious challenge to the authority of Mr Tung 's leadership, thereby preventing alarm bells from ringing."
